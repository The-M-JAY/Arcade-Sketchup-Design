This is a preliminary model of a VR arcade I made on an old model of sketchup


## The Alembic file is Arcade2.abc, and is usable in blender. 
The abc version is easier to quickly look through, which the DAE file contains all the objects. 

## The Dae file needs a collada extension in blender to open, which you can install through this repo : https://github.com/ekztal/Blender-v5-DAE-Importer-Add-on
